                        "They say long distance never works and I think thats stupid! Hearts pick people not places,
                        And it kills me that your place is 9.935km away. But that doesn't mean that i love you like you live next door.
                        But, it also doesn't mean that it's not hard. Every night i miss your hand when i wanna sleep, and every morning i
                        miss your hug and your good morning kisses. I Have never missed someone so deeply who i haven't actually lost, and missing you is
                        one of the most difficult things i ever had to do. Watching all the other couples get to have the little things like goodbye kisses or falling
                        asleep together insted of goodnights whispers through the phone. But it is all worth the moments i'm around your arms again and feels like i'm
                        home again. And drives me crazy not being with you everyday or in special moments but it would be worst not having you at all.
                        So, I'll wait as long as it takes and I'll love you as much as i can. 'Cause 12 hours plane flights are a small price to pay for the forever I can not wait
                        to spend with you. So I'll find comfort in pictures of us, on your red checkered shirt, that i love to sleep with, on our videos call and your goodnight videos.
                        So, i'll looking forward to the moment that i can be in your arms again and trying to get used to home being so far."
